          Safety Improvements in Formula One
        </h2>
        <p class="leg-p">
        The tragic events at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix led to the deaths of Roland Ratzenberger in qualifying and then the loss of racing legend Aytron Senna the following day. These events sparked a new and more intense focus on safety research and it is these improvements that perhaps represent the greatest legacy of Senna and Ratzenberger.

        In the aftermath of the Imola crashes, then FIA President Max Mosley instituted a host of changes. An immediate programme of circuit alteration was undertaken and using computer analysis the FIA identified a range of dangerous corners that needed to be made safer. Test procedures for tyre barriers become mandatory and barriers also had to be secured by rubber belts. The speed limit in the pit lane is reduced to 80 km/h in practice and 120 km/h in races and stricter standards for helmet design were introduced.
        
        In the two decades since, the FIA has continued a rigorous safety research and development programme.
        
        Crash tests were expanded to include lateral tests in 1995 and two years later the first accident data recorders were installed in F1 cars, giving the governing body more information than ever before on the effects of impacts on materials and types of car construction. By 1999, the sport also had higher cockpit sides to aid head protection, wheel tethers were introduced to prevent dangerous detachments in accidents and run-off areas were modified to help reduced speed. Additionally, four medically-equipped rescue vehicles and a car for the FIA-doctor were made compulsory.
        
        The advent of the 21st century saw no let up in progress. Roll over bars were raised, impact tests became even more stringent, with ever-tighter tolerances imposed on impacts from all quarters, and in 2003, use of the HANS system to protect the driver’s head and neck was made mandatory.
        
        In 2004, research into motor sport safety took another step forward when the FIA established the FIA Institute, a non-profit organisation designed to develop and improve safety on the track. The subsequent establishment of the Motor Sport Safety Development fund in 2009 further pushed the boundaries of what could be achieved in protecting competitors, officials and spectators.
        
        Despite all these developments, racing remains an inherently dangerous pursuit and the quest for ultimate safety is an ongoing, daily endeavour.

      <h2 class="leg-2">The Senna Foundation</h2>
      <h3 class="leg-3">Senna's Vision</h3>
      <p class="leg-p">
          Shortly before Senna’s fatal crash at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, he had talked with his sister, Viviane Senna, about setting up a charitable foundation to help the young. But this would not be a foundation that built schools. It was far more ambitious than that and ahead of its time. The idea was that the Ayrton Senna Institute should engineer a systemic change in Brazil’s education system – a change that would deliver the greatest possible improvement across the country.

          Twenty six years later, the institute can claim to have helped 15 million children. It is present in 17 states and over 660 districts, improving the training of over 70,000 teaching professionals each year and effectively supporting the education of over 1.9 million students a year.
      </p>
      <h3 class="leg-3">The Power of Storytelling</h3>
      <p class="leg-p">
      Much of the institute’s lasting success arises from the enduring story of Ayrton Senna, the three times Formula One champion, who is still revered in his home country and respected as one of the greatest ever racing drivers globally. That allows the institute to raise funds through the brand of Ayrton Senna or Senninha, a children’s character he inspired.

      That power of the story of the young driver also attracts companies to partner with the institute. They donate money and knowledge in the cause of Brazilian education.
        
      So, what is Viviane’s dream for the institute? “To fully develop people on a large scale and with efficiency so that Brazil becomes a country for all, not the few. Everything depends on a quality education that reaches all people, giving them a chance to work as citizens of the country and the world.”
