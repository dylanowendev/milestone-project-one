-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are Red for foreground text boxes, and black for the background to provide contrast. Greens were also to represent the colours in Senna's race helmet (green, red, yellow).
    -   #### Typography
        -   The font used for the largest headings (on landing page, h1s through doc) is 'Carrois Gothic SC'. Roboto is used for smaller headings (h3 etc), wit Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason either font isn't being imported into the site correctly. 
    -   #### Imagery
        - The large, hero image on the landing page is designed to catch the readers attention. The colour palette was altered to give the image a more muted tone so the image would blend better with the black background, appearing more subtle.
