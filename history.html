          <strong><h1>First Title Win, Japanese Grand Prix</h1></strong>
          <strong class="edate"><p>1988</p></strong>
          <p class="etxt">
            1988 was dominated by Ayrton and Alain, the pair winning all but one of the races heading into the title decider. Either could win the championship and Ayrton drew first blood by taking pole position. However, he came unstuck at the start of the race by stalling on the grid. He hurriedly bump-started the car on Suzuka’s downhill start-finish straight, but ultimately dropped to 14th. And so began one of the most remarkable comeback drives, which culminated in seizing the lead from Alain on lap 27 and Ayrton winning his first world championship in dramatic fashion.

          <strong><h1>Senna and Prost Crash, Japanese Grand Prix</h1></strong>
          <strong class="edate"><p>1989</p></strong>
          <p class="etxt">
            Ayrton and Alain’s rivalry boiled over in the 1989 title decider, the pair colliding with seven laps to go. Alain abandoned his car believing the championship was settled and their race over, but Ayrton persevered. Despite a pitstop to change his front wing which cost him the lead, he spectacularly chased down new leader Alessandro Nannini and passed him three laps from the chequered flag. It was all in vain though, as Ayrton was disqualified for using an escape road to rejoin the circuit after his coming together with Alain, ultimately handing the title to his rival.

          <strong><h1>Famous Monaco Grand Prix On-board Camera Footage</h1></strong>
          <strong class="edate"><p>1990</p></strong>
          <p class="etxt">
            It may not have been his finest lap around the Principality – his exploits in 1988 take that honour – but millions of people have watched, in complete awe, the onboard footage of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3_FCglY1vk&t" target="_blank"><span>Ayrton’s qualifying lap</span></a> for the 1990 Monaco Grand Prix. And it’s hard not to see why. It shows Ayrton in full flow, masterfully tackling the twists and turns of Monaco in the McLaren MP4/5B.

          <strong><h1>Senna Takes Prost Out, Japanese Grand Prix</h1></strong>
          <strong class="edate"><p>1990</p></strong>
          <p class="etxt">
            Ayrton claimed vengeance at Suzuka in 1990, after controversially missing out on the title to Alain Prost the preceding season. Starting alongside one another on the front row, neither made it beyond the first corner. Ayrton took Alain out; the collision immediately ended the race for both and secured Ayrton his second world championship. When quizzed by Jackie Stewart in the aftermath, Ayrton was unrepentant: “If you no longer go for a gap that exists, you are no longer a racing driver, because we are competing. We are competing to win.”

          <strong><h1>First Brazilian Grand Prix Win</h1></strong>
          <strong class="edate"><p>1991</p></strong>
          <p class="etxt">
            Victory on home soil eluded Ayrton until the 1991. And even then, he had to do it the hard way. When Nigel Mansell was forced to retire, Ayrton was left out in front with a lead of 40 seconds over Riccardo Patrese. However, that gap reduced dramatically in the closing stages due to a gearbox failure that meant Ayrton could only use sixth gear. Against all odds, he held onto victory by 2.991 seconds. Physically and emotionally exhausted, Ayrton had to be helped out of the car and was barely able to lift the winner’s trophy in an emotional podium ceremony. He would go on to win the series and claim his third World Driver's Championship.

          <strong><h1>Heroic Actions, Belgium Grand Prix</h1></strong>
          <strong class="edate"><p>1992</p></strong>
          <p class="etxt">
            During Friday practice, Erik Comas crashed heavily at the high-speed Blanchimont corner and was knocked unconscious – his engine still running and his foot pressing on the accelerator, pumping fuel into the system. Senna was right behind him on track. He immediately stopped and, risking his own life, ran to help his stricken colleague. Spotting the danger of an imminent explosion, he switched off the engine and held Comas' head in a stable position until the paramedics arrived. Comas later explained that Ayrton’s actions saved his life.

          <strong class="edate"><p>1993</p></strong>
          <p class="etxt">
            In his last race for McLaren, Ayrton did what he did best. He stormed to pole on the tight, fiddly Adelaide circuit and won the race. He was untouchable, finishing over nine seconds ahead of his great rival Alain Prost. As the pair stood together on the podium for the last time, neither of them could have imagined it would be Ayrton’s final grand prix victory. Bounding onto the top step, Ayrton made this a moment of public reconciliation, seizing Alain’s hand and slapping him on the back.

          <strong><h1>Untimely Death, San Marino Grand Prix</h1></strong>
          <strong class="edate"><p>1993</p></strong>
          <p class="etxt">
            In 1994, Senna left his longtime team McLaren, which he had joined in 1988 and won three World Drivers' Championships with in 1988, 1990 and 1991, to join Williams, replacing his former teammate Alain Prost. On 1 May 1994, Senna colided with a concrete barrier whilst he was leading the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in Italy. The previous day, Roland Ratzenberger had died when his car crashed during qualification for the race. His and Senna's accidents were the worst of several accidents that took place that weekend and were the first fatal accidents to occur during a Formula One race meeting in twelve years. They became a turning point in the safety of Formula One, prompting the implementation of new safety measures and the re-formation of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association.
